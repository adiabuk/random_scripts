			<h2>About Us</h2>
<a name="company"></a>
			<h3>The Company</h3>
			<p><strong>Amrox Ltd</strong>  is a Linux consultancy established in 2006.  We provide a range of Linux consultancy services from Support and monitoring to sys admin and development.  Although we are a UK based company we understand that such services are sometimes hard to come by and as such we are happy to deal with overseas companies and individuals.  For UK based clients we are also able to provide on-site services, if required.  Please use the <a href="contact.html" target="content"><strong>contact</strong></a> form to tell us about your requirements.</p>

<h3>The Consultant</h3>
	<p>My name is Amro Diab.  I have been a Linux Consultant since 2004 working on a range of different technologies on a range of different platforms.  I also have a great deal of experience with other Operating Systems including Microsoft Windows, UNIX, Mac OS (including both classic and OSX).  </p>

<h3>The Work</h3>
<p>After working with many different clients/industries I began to relaise where the shortfalls are within this arena, and where the work is required more.  In a typical organisation utilising Linux technologies there would not be many staff employed on a full time basis supporting the products.  Typically at least 70% less than other systems.  After the main bulk of design work has been done and the system is pronnounced stable, the only work left will be the routine work.  Often this work is less eventfull and results in the Linux staff leaving their changed role in the search for different opportunities.  This is true for both permanent and contract IT staff especially in the global credit crunch.  This often leaves big gaps in knowledge and a valnerable position to be in when situations occur.</p>

<p>I have also witnessed many occasions where organisations spend money on vendor support only to realise that they are not in the position to use it when required.  This could be due the turn around time, company procedures, and staff turnover within the vendor support unit.  It is estimated that tens of thousands of pounds per year are spent on services which are never used but just there to appease management. For our services you do not need to fill in copious amounts of paperwork for a request, nor do you need to answer irrelavent questions to satisify a procedure.  You simply need to give us a call, or send us an email.</p>

<h3>Why Linux?</h3><a name="linux"></a>
<p>This question always does raise some interesting debates.  I can only talk about my experiences and opinions as there is no single correct answer.  
My main reason is flexability.  Flexability on what is installed, how it is installed, and how it behaves.  To date, I have yet to find another Operating System which has such attributes. </p>

<p>One of the key concepts in Linux is that everything is a file.  In actual fact when you drill down to the basics this is true for every operating system however it is often not portrayed as such.  In Linux, an application is a file, the configuration is a stored in a file, all the libraries are files, and even the service launcher, GUIs, locking mechanisms, and logs are all files.  For this reason, it is easy to support, configure, and troubleshoot virtually any Linux application, even one which one has not come accross before.  There is far less rooting around looking for where the configuration is stored, what format its in, and how/if it can be modified.</p>
