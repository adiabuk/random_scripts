Small app to render sets of coordinates to ASCII line art.
Input when prompted as follows: (x1,y1)-(x2,y2)
where x1, y1 are the xy coordinates of the the 1st coordinate and
x2, y2 are the 2nd coordinates.  Any spaces will be ignored.

NOTE:
For the '-' (minus) character, ensure you use the minus key on the keyboard
(ascii key 45) , and not the ascii key 150 dash character which will be used
if you manually copy/paste example coordinates from instruction pdf document.

the x range is 0 to 19 and y is 0 to 9
eg...
(4,9)-(14,0)

Multiple point sets can be input resulting in multiple graphs.
eg...
(4,9)-(14,0),(0,4)-(19,4)
